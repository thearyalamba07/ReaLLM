## ToDo

### URGENT
- [x] On/Off button in popup controlling whole popup - @Malhar

- [x] Input data match null bug that shows in chrome extension manager - @Utkarsh
- [x] Google button gets clicked even when no prompt entered - @Malhar
- [x] finetune all events and clicks and their results
- [x] Save prompts when user hits enter
- [x] Save prompts even when shortcut is pressed (ctrl+shift+Y)
- [x] "AI" gets corrected to "A"
- [ ] Fix UI for GPT 4 and GPT 3.5, Google, Placement - @Arya
- [ ] Find appropriate backend deployment service and DEPLOY - @All
- [ ] Refresh
- [ ] old prompt comes back to textarea after popup is clicked

### Non-Critical
- [x] Google Button added - @Malhar
- [x] Save user prompts - @Utkarsh
- [x] Google button co-efficient - @Utkarsh
- [x] No processing once detected paste from clipboard
- [ ] Animation for google - @Utkarsh
- [ ] Dropdown near button - and feature to limit words - @Arya @Utkarsh
- [ ] Scrollable UI is not so readable
- [ ] Co-efficient code can be better - maybe JSON
- [ ] Save prompts in a better way not csv

### Far Future(?)
- [ ] Adding NLP features, generally improve the backend processing - @Utkarsh
    * Subjective and Objective??

### Misc - @Any
- [ ] Remove all waste files (especially assets) (and whatever .DS_Store is)
- [ ] Add gitignore so that stupid files like DS_ignore dont creep in
- [ ] Add a README.md
    * Add a GIF of the extension in action
    * What ReaLLM
    * Installation + usage instructions
    * Insert "dadi dadu somewhere randomly"
    * Probably get ChatGPT to do all this crap
